# Discord Naf Bot
A fun bot for a private server which was used for two years before I took it offline. Used for TypeScript learning and relied on an old version of DiscordJS pre-slash commands, so probably not much use to anyone.

### Features
- Automatic birthday messages
- Generate a Don Cheadle's Word of the Day meme
- Embed uninspirational quotes from InspiroBot.me
- Reaction-based self-assignable roles
- Track farmed reactions (so you can see who's got the most KEKWs and OMEGALULs in the server)
- TikTok automatic video scraping and linking (stopped working after a few months, fun while it lasted)
- Bot commands and event listeners organised using directories
